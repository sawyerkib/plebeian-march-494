To start the project we made the index.html and the all.css. We wrote the basic code skeleton down before we started with the code. We had a `<head>` and a `<body>`. The first page we worked on was the home page. We went over to the css and messed with the background a little bit. After I got a hang of that we started on content. I pasted all content on the home page in the body. I looked at it on the web and then saw it needed titles. We added titles for each page. Then my dad asked me what color I wanted for my website and I said more of a dark background but don't really have a solid color in my mind. I started seeing which color I liked most and saw I liked black background with white text. Next, we worked on the text font, I decided on open sans.

After we had all the basics down we started thinking about organization. I didn't really know how to organize the website so my dad showed me what it looked like to separate sections with color. I decided I liked that so we went with white then black and white and so on. My dad showed me how the code overwrites itself, so most of the website can be one color, but certain sections are another. I had to create a class named `dark-section`. I put a class on every section that was going to be black with that class. When I looked back at my website I realized the colors seemed to squish the writing. My dad explained to me that it needed padding so he added that and it looked a lot better.

After all the content added and titled, we needed pictures. I used some of the pictures I just found and some I already picked out to picture all the sections. I first needed a hero. A hero is a big picture that grabs someones attention to the page. I found a good photo for the hero but my dad pointed out that we needed to alter it a little bit. We took the photo into Adobe Photoshop and we tinted the photo and enlarged it. I wanted to tint the photo because I liked the idea of it from the Woman's March website.

I learned how to use photoshop and why it's not always a good idea to enlarge a photo. After we have placed the photo in the site my dad asked if I wanted a logo. I said yes so my dad and I went looking for all different stuff plebeians used, made, and handled. We decided to do bread, coins, and pottery. These were all little clip arts that we placed in Adobe Illustrator to enhance. We placed them all in a triangle and changed them all to a basic color. My dad placed an X in the middle so the items were each in a space of the X. We decided we didn't like that so we deleted it and tried again. My dad started out idea with just simply writing Plebeian March. He searched the web for a fist and I picked one I liked and we placed that in Illustrator. My dad wrote the date on it and a square around the fist. He told me to pick a color for all the things. I messed around with a lot of different colors to see which was better. I decided on red/orange for the fist, white for the box and yellow for the text. We placed that over the dulled picture on the home screen and it looked good but the fist was half white and half blue inside because it was hanging off the edge so my dad changed the basic inside to white.

I had to add all the images so my dad said to try it out for myself so I did. I copied the previous image code and typed it on the second section and replaced the file name with the correct one and it worked. The image was just like the last one. Next we tried to take on the challenge of the slideshow. My dad forgot how to make a slideshow so he googled it to jog his memory. I wrote the basic code but my dad wrote the complex code and the JavaScript because that was too advanced.

We couldn't figure out what day the actual march was or what calendar they used so we made up a present day date.
