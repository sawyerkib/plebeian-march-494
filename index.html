          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Plebeians are 95% of the population. We are shopkeepers, peasants, and craftspeople. We have little voice in the government and are treated bad by the patricians. We are forced into serving in the army. If we leave the patricians must meet our needs.</p>

          <h2>What We Want</h2>
          <p>Patricians, we want the ability to elect officials called tribunes if the the plebeians. They will speak for us in the senate and with the consuls. We also want to elect a lawmaking body called the Council of Plebs. The Council will only make laws the plebeians. Our last demand is for the laws to be published on tablets called the twelve tables.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Once Rome was ruled by Etruscan kings. They ruled Rome between 616 B.C.E. to 509 B.C.E. The patricians got fed up with the Etruscan rule. The patricians rebelled in 509 B.C.E. Us plebeians did not have a good life under the rule of the kings. We were treated badly, we had no good land and the king chose and did everything for us. When we heard the patricians rebelled and started a republic we thought things would change for the plebeians. Nothing changed for us. The patricians were elected by other patricians then treated us bad. The partitions can't treat us bad anymore! Join us on the march to make history.</p>

          <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
          <p>Our city is a violent one. We have gladiator fights and we take over neighboring cities, but we will march out peacefully wanting our demands met. The patricians can’t fight us. We are their army. We are forced to fight for them. If most of us plebeians march out, the patricians would have lost  95% of the population and, all their fighters and merchants. The patrician have most of the high and good land but they don’t have fighters. We have no voice in the government. This city we live in is great. We have been influenced by many people and took their ideas and changed them into our style. March out and make the government better.</p>
